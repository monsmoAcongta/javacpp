By the end of this article, you will have a complete trap beat that sounds like Shawty Redd. Let's get started!
  
## Setting up your DAW and loading the drum kit
 
The first step is to set up your DAW (digital audio workstation) and load the Shawty Redd drum kit. You can use any DAW that you are comfortable with, such as FL Studio, Ableton Live, Logic Pro, etc. For this tutorial, we will use FL Studio as an example.
 
To load the Shawty Redd drum kit, you need to unzip the downloaded file and copy the folder to your DAW's sample library. In FL Studio, you can do this by going to Options > File Settings and adding the folder to the Browser extra search folders. Then, you can access the drum kit from the Browser window on the left side of the screen.
 
Next, you need to create a new project and set the tempo to 140 BPM (beats per minute), which is a common tempo for trap beats. You can do this by clicking on the tempo display at the top of the screen and typing in 140. You also need to set the time signature to 4/4, which means four beats per measure. You can do this by clicking on the time signature display next to the tempo and selecting 4/4.
 
Now you are ready to start making your beat!
  
## Creating a simple drum pattern
 
The next step is to create a simple drum pattern using the Shawty Redd drum kit. A drum pattern is a sequence of drum sounds that repeats throughout the beat. It usually consists of four elements: kick, snare, hi-hat and percussion.
 
To create a drum pattern, you need to use the Channel Rack window, which is where you can add and edit your sounds. You can open it by clicking on the Channel Rack icon at the top of the screen or pressing F6 on your keyboard.
 
Then, you need to add the drum sounds from the Shawty Redd drum kit to the Channel Rack. You can do this by dragging and dropping them from the Browser window or right-clicking on an empty slot and selecting Insert > Sampler. You can rename each sound by right-clicking on its name and typing in a new one.
 
Once you have added the drum sounds, you need to arrange them on the Step Sequencer, which is the grid of buttons below each sound. Each button represents a step or a beat in the pattern. You can activate or deactivate a step by left-clicking on it. You can also change the length of the pattern by dragging the horizontal bar at the bottom of the Step Sequencer.
 
A typical trap drum pattern has a kick on the first and third beat, a snare on the second and fourth beat, and a hi-hat on every eighth note. You can create this pattern by following these steps:

1. Click on the kick sound and activate the first and ninth step.
2. Click on the snare sound and activate the fifth and thirteenth step.
3. Click on the hi-hat sound and activate every other step.

This is a basic drum pattern that you can use as a foundation for your beat. You can spice it up by adding some percussions, such as claps, rims, shakers or bells. You can also change the velocity or volume of each step by right-clicking on it and dragging up or down. This will create some variation and groove in your pattern.
 
Here is an example of a more advanced drum pattern with some percussions and velocity changes:
